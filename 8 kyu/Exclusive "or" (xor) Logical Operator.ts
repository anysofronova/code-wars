// In some scripting languages like PHP, there exists a logical operator (e.g. &&, ||, and, or, etc.) called the
// "Exclusive Or" (hence the name of this Kata). The exclusive or evaluates two booleans. It then returns true if
// exactly one of the two expressions are true, false otherwise. For example:

const xor = (a, b) => !a == b;
